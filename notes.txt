## functions ##
# definition of a process
   # to avoid repeatation of code 
   # to arrange the program
   # 
#  type of function
      # build in function  - which are already defined ex-print,max,min,len,etc
      # user defined function  - itself defined function (itself example type)
## step to br followed while using function:
  

  ## in built function:
          ## call the function
  ## user defined function:
          ## write the definition block
          ## call the function
